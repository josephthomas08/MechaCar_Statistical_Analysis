# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis
Statistical Analysis using R


## Deliverable 1 


### D1.1 The MechaCar_mpg.csv file is imported and read into a dataframe

### D1.2 An RScript is written for a linear regression model to be performed on all six variables

### D1.3 An RScript is written to create the statistical summary of the linear regression model with the intended p-values

### D1.4 There is a summary that addresses all three questions

The above captured image from R analytical tool provides us with sufficent evidence that the probability values of the variables especially  "Vehicle Length" and "Ground Clearance" are very much smaller from our significant value of 0.05. These variables provide non random amount of variance to MPG values.

The p-value is 5.35e-11 which is much smaller than our assumed significance value of 0.05, hence we have sufficient evidence that slope of our linear model is not 0.

The r-squared value is 0.7 which as we understand predicts that  the future data points will fit to our linear model therefore  we can safely consider that this model effectively predcits the MPG of MechaCar prototypes.





## Deliverable 2 


### D2.1 The Suspension_Coil.csv file is imported and read into a dataframe 
### D2.2 An RScript is written to create a total summary dataframe that has the mean, median, variance, and standard deviation of the PSI for all manufacturing lots 
### D2.3 An RScript is written to create a lot summary dataframe that has the mean, median, variance, and standard deviation for each manufacturing lot 
### D2.4 There is a summary that addresses the design specification requirement for all the manufacturing lots and each lot individually 


## Deliverable 3 


### D3.1 An RScript is written for t-test that compares all manufacturing lots against mean PSI of the population 
### D3.2 An RScript is written for three t-tests that compare each manufacturing lot against mean PSI of the population 
### D3.3 There is a summary of the t-test results across all manufacturing lots and for each lot 



## Deliverable 4 

### 4.1 A metric to be tested is mentioned 
### 4.2 A null hypothesis or an alternative hypothesis is described 
### 4.3 A statistical test is described to test the hypothesis
### 4.4 The data for the statistical test is described
